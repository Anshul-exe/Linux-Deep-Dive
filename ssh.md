# SSH Command

`ssh` is a command-line tool that allows you to securely connect to a remote server or computer. It uses the `SSH` protocol to establish a secure connection and provides a way to access the remote system's shell or execute commands on it.

> [!NOTE] > `SSH` (Secure Shell) stands for Secure Shell and is the client program used to connect to a remote server securely, while `sshd` (Secure Shell Daemon/Server) is the server program that listens for incoming connections.
> `ssh` is the client which is used to connect to the server while `sshd` is used to listen for incoming connections and authenticate the client.
> Think of ssh as a phone (the caller) and `sshd` as a landline that is waiting to receive calls. If the landline (`sshd`) is turned off, no one can call in
